            <p><center><h3>At a distance of 1 km from Dawki Market, Umngot is a small river that flows through Dawki in the East Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya.
                 Also known as Dawki River, it is one of the pleasant places to visit in Meghalaya and among the prime places to visit in Dawki.Situated near 
                 the Indo-Bangladesh border, Umngot River is the cleanest river that flows in India.Umngot River marks the separation between Ri Pnar of 
                 Jaintia Hills and Hima Khyrim of Khasi Hills over which hangs a single span suspension bridge.Built in 1932 by the British, the bridge can 
                 accommodate only one vehicle at a time and acts as a gateway to neighboring Bangladesh.Umngot River is a prime fishing spot for both Indian
                 and Bangladeshi fishermen. The river not only flows through green ambience but also shines like silver.Also, boating in the crystal clear water
                 is an experience of lifetime. The ride starts from the border point and went up the river till a small island type place where there were boulders
                 all over the place.While boating, one can clearly see the marine life in the water. The town attracts large number of tourists especially in the
                 month of March-April as it hosts the annual boat race on the Umngot River.One can also see the Indo-Bangladesh border nearby. There is no fencing,
                 no demarcation so it is in fact extremely easy to cross over into Bangladesh illegally.</br>

                <p><center><h2><i>Wei Sawdong is one of most beautiful place in meghalaya its stuctered way of water fall and the clearness of it is the main beauty of this place</i></h2></center></p>

                <p><center><h3>The fall is situated some 60 km southwest of Shillong in East Khasi Hills district and is in close proximity to another major waterfall, Dainthlen Falls.
                     The name Wei Sawdong derives from the Khasi language (wei - resembling a pool, sawdong - square-shaped), spoken locally.Wei Sawdong is difficult to access, 
                     and the trek to the waterfall is along an out-and-back trail and challenging.The falls are especially known for their bluish-green, crystal-clear water.</h3></center></p>

                <p><center><h3>Most tourists compare the Wei Sawdong to the Pamukkale hot springs in Turkey.You may call them a mini version of the hot springs as it is a 3-tier
                       waterfall.Surrounded by greenery on all sides, you have to take a steep trek in the hills to finally get a view of these hidden waterfalls.
                       Having to find these waterfalls does add to its beauty and charm. When you get its first aerial view, you will be startled for a moment to see its
                       pure blue colour, form and tranquillity.All you can hear in this area is the sound of the water falling down from the 3 levels. Your eyes will be caught
                       up with the beautiful blue spot appearing from nowhere in the middle of greenery.Such is the attraction of these waterfalls. Once you’re there, you can’t 
                       stop staring at them.Although officially you’re not allowed to swim here, you might like to dip your feet a little bit.The water is ice cold and very deep here</h3></center></p>

                <center><font size="16" color="black">3.Double Decker Root Bridge</font></br></center>
                <center><p><h2><i> Meghalaya prides itself as a place where people live at one with nature and probably the most powerful example of that is the amazing phenomenon of the living root bridge.</i></h2></p></center>
                <center><img src="C:\Users\roopi\Desktop\photos\mg11.jpg" height="600" width="700"></center>
                <p><h3>These bridges created out of the secondary roots of the rubber fig tree by Khasi villagers have to be seen to be believed:
                       they are like something taken straight out of Tolkien’s fictional Middle Earth. You can find a number of such bridges spanning streams next to villages in the East Khasi Hills
                       and all are accessible from Cherrapunji.But the Mother Goddess of them all is the totally unique one-of-a-kind double decker living root bridge found deep down in a river valley
                       next to the village of Nongriat</h3></p>
                <p><h3><b><u>What makes the living root bridge at Nongriat special?</u></b><br/>
                            The living root bridge at Nongriat has two levels, apparently because the river rose so high one season that it covered the original bridge and so the Khasis had to build another
                            one.It is truly a sight to behold, with the gnarled roots stretching right across the river to grasp the other side.</h3></p>
                <br/>
                <p><h3><u>Where do you start the trek to the living root bridge at Nongriat?</u><br/>
                          The base station for the Nongriat trek is Cherrapunji, which is about a two-hour drive (54km) from Shillong.Ideally stay there overnight and then next morning drive to the roadhead
                          hamlet of Tyrna which is 30min (12km) from where the descent starts.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>In total to reach the double decker bridge we need to treck for 3500 steps so in total of going and coming back it takes 7000 steps of trecking </h3></p>

                <center><p><h3>Mawsmai Cave is located at a short distance from Sohra and is an easy attraction to access and explore.
                             There are some places inside the cave where you will need to squeeze around and crawl – and this adds to the experience of cave exploration. 
                             The Mawsmai cave route that is accessible to tourists is not very long and is very safe so you do not want to miss out on this unique opportunity.
                              The cave is also famous for its fossils, some which you can spot if you spend some time peering at the walls and formations inside.<br/>
                <br/>

                            The ten longest caves (and more) in the country are all in Meghalaya.These subterranean networks spread across the southern ranges like a complex
                            network of routes formed by the erosion of limestone and unrelenting flow of water.Mawsmai offers a glimpse into this fascinating world underneath our feet.<br/>
                <br/>
                            The approach to the Mawsmai caves is a pleasant one – a short walk through a thickly wooded area which is constantly filled with the chirps of birds and creaking of
                            insects.Many travellers like to relax or take a stroll in the surrounding forests after they have visited the cave.</h3></p></center>

                <center><h3> Shillong started out as the capital of Assam and later became a full-fledged state in 1972. 
                            Since then, Shillong has evolved into a ‘hip’ hill station with ardent music lovers of all genres, especially rock, jazz, blues, hip-hop etc. 
                            Culturally rich and unique, the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo tribes of the region belong to a matrilineal society (kinship with the mother or the female line).<br/>
                            <br/>
                            This ‘uber-cool’ town has many attractions to offer, like the century-old churches, the 18-hole Shillong Golf Course, Ward’s Lake, museums and more!
                             Laitlum Canyons which is located about 24kms from Shillong literally translates to the ‘End of the Hills.’ Blanketed in velvety white clouds and rolling hills and deep gorges 
                             the view may remind you of a scene from the musical ‘The Sound of Music’.This majestic panoramic landscape is one of the best points for stunning sunsets!</h3></center>
